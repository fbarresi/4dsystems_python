# Python Wrapper for 4DSystems Diablo16 and Picaso Displays C Serial Libraries

This repository contains python wrapper classes for C Serial Library by [4DSystems][1] meant for their Picaso and Disablo16 displays.

This is still a work in progress and as such is delivered "**AS IS**". I'm testing some of the functions myself for my own projects. If you happen to find a bug or have any suggestion please contact me or file a bug report.

Thank you.
